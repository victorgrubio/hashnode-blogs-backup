Many of us may have tried to start technical writing and left it after a week. Perhaps you've created a blog but stopped posting after a year. You might have wondered if you would ever be the one offering valuable replies on StackOverflow.

If you can relate to these experiences, allow me to share my main motivation for writing:

# Traditional Learning Methods

Let's face it, traditional learning methods often fall short. During my college years as a Telecommunications Engineering student, I had to absorb a lot of information in a limited time frame. Picture this: 8 exams in just 4 days. It was intense. Initially, I relied on memorizing exercises from previous years and regurgitating fixed patterns. And it worked for a while.

What would I do? What they have educated me for: Try to learn how to do some exercises from previous years. Memorize the parts that are always asked the same way.

> It worked for a while

However, everything changed when I pursued a Machine Learning master's degree. The complex math I encountered demanded a deeper level of understanding. Thanks to exceptional teachers, I shifted my focus to grasping concepts and truly comprehending them. The knowledge gained during that period remains etched in my mind.

### Here is when everything made sense.

# Overcome the ‚ÄúTutorial Syndrome‚Äù

We were born in the era of YouTube, where countless videos exist on practically every topic imaginable. Content creators possess an infinite wealth of knowledge at their fingertips. But let's pause and reflect: How much of that content do we retain after three days? I remember very little. Please don't misunderstand me‚ÄîI appreciate YouTube and the incredible free content it offers.

However, watching videos, reading books, and scrolling through posts are all passive activities. They require less attention compared to activities like coding. On occasion, I've stumbled across intriguing concepts in books that have fascinated me and triggered a surge of dopamine. Yet, more often than not, those highlighted passages quickly fade from memory. In contrast, lines of code and text that I've created through sweat and perseverance tend to leave a lasting impression.

# Enhancing Understanding of Topics

> Name a topic that writing didn‚Äôt help you understand better. It's hard, isn't it?

Let me share an example from my own experience. I was reading "Head First Design Patterns"‚Äîa highly recommended book. Each chapter delved deep into one or more [design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern). Although I read it almost every day, after a week, I realized I couldn't recall any of the patterns or how to apply them.

That's when I decided to tackle a different approach. I opted to code the design patterns in a different programming language. Since the book's examples were in Java, I chose Python as the obvious choice for me.

> It took me three days to make the Abstract Factory pattern work.

But let me assure you, after that intensive exercise, I truly understood how to implement the abstract factory pattern. As a fun side note, I also became well-versed in modeling a pizza franchise business! üòÜ

The key takeaway here is that learning complex concepts and embedding them in your memory takes time and effort. We might be able to develop simple skills without constantly referring to guides, thanks to trial and error and the valuable insights provided by StackOverflow. But for profound understanding and long-term retention, patience and repetition are essential.

# Learning one thing at a time

As software developers, we reside in an industry that incessantly evolves, forcing us to adapt and acquire a broad range of skills. I love learning new things and experiencing that invigorating feeling when reading a paragraph that resonates with me. However, I must admit that what I find captivating today may be forgotten tomorrow.

That's why I recommend, not only to others but to myself as well‚Äîthe one who often needs the reminder the most‚Äîto focus on learning one thing at a time. Dedicate a week to mastering a small, specific concept, such as Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) in Java. Once you've learned this concept, consider writing an article about it. Feel free to visit the article whenever you have doubts or need a refresher.

For more complex subjects, like a cloud certification, break it down into manageable concepts. Let's say you plan to complete the certification within two months. Divide your time accordingly and dedicate each week to learning a specific service, following the provider's guide.

Read articles, engage in hands-on labs, write about your experiences, and repeat this process.

> When you test your knowledge, rest assured that you'll have a solid understanding of the material.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, writing enhances the learning process. This is not just a casual claim, but a fact. Let's recap the key points that illustrate the importance of technical writing for developers:

* **Traditional memorization-based learning methods fall short.**
    
* **Profound understanding is crucial for effectively applying complex concepts.**
    
* **Writing requires explaining, which reinforces understanding.**
    
* **Passive learning (reading, watching) is not as effective as active learning (coding, writing).**
    
* **Attempting tutorials in different programming languages or approaching the same problem from a different perspective increases comprehension.**
    
* **We can revisit articles, but we can't revisit our fleeting thoughts.**
    
* **Focus on learning one thing at a time for better retention.**
